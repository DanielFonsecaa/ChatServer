This project was given to us in the 7th week of my Bootcamp at Code for All_.

The project was to develop a chat server. In class that week, we were learning about networks, threads, sockets, and concurrency. We were then asked to develop a chat server that incorporated all these subjects.

The commands was made with strategy design pattern.

Still a lot to do, that I want to implement. The client still not working but I will get there.
Work in progress, but with nc you can connect as many you want
