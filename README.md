# ChatServer
ChatServer with netcat and client


ChatServer that can connect many clients.

Work in progress, but with nc you can connect as many you want, can see who is connected with /list, and quit with /quit.
The commands was made with strategy design pattern.

Still a lot to do, that I want to implement.

This project was given to us in the 7th week of my Bootcamp at code for all.
