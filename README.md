# ChatServer
ChatServer with netcat and client


The project was to develop a chat server. In class that week, we were learning about networks, threads, sockets, and concurrency. We were then asked to develop a chat server that incorporated all these subjects.

Work in progress, but with nc you can connect as many you want, can see who is connected with /list, and quit with /quit.
The commands was made with strategy design pattern.

Still a lot to do, that I want to implement.
The client still not working but I will get there

This project was given to us in the 7th week of my Bootcamp at code for all.
